# Tabloid CLI -Proof of Concept

Command Line Interface [Proof of Concept(POC)] application to organize blog posts. The user can manage blogs, posts, authors and tags for searching specific blogs, posts and authors related to the subject. This POC will be a simplified implementation of the idea that will be used to test the business idea to ensure that customers would find it valuable, and also to allow the team to get a handle on the concept. After we complete the POC we will use it to evaluate our business idea and determine if we need to pivot (change direction) toward another idea.
